Starting list voting.

The program will show you 10 themes. You have the ability to vote YES/NO for all of them at once.
If you only want to vote for certain themes, include their index in the command. For example, 'Y 2 3 12' will vote YES for themes 2, 3 and 12.

To prevent abuse, you can only flag one theme at a time. Make sure to include its index.
