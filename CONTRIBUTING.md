# How to contribute

If you want to make a contribution to this script, please make sure you follow these guidelines:

- Make sure you explain your changes in the pull request. Pull requests without comments or ambiguous changes will be denied.
- Please answer any questions that may come up under your PR.
- Please **do not** increase the version number in utils/CONSTATNS.py. The updater currently directly fetches the newest release number from the main repository branch and should only be incremented in version bump commits. Pull requests increasing this number will be denied.
